JumSDL
======

This is a project that provides Objective-C bindings for the SDL library (http://www.libsdl.org/).
The struct SDL_Surface, for instance, is embodied by the object JumSurface. Note that currently,
JumSDL is *very* limited in function.

To compile, download and open the Xcode project, and build the framework. If you do not wish for
Xcode to automatically place the framework in your /Library/Frameworks/ folder, remove the "Run
Script" build phase in the Build Phases settings pane.
